# AWS Cloud Portfolio

Hands-on AWS Solutions Architect Associate projects built using the Free Tier and AWS Console.

This portfolio documents real AWS projects deployed step-by-step using services like IAM, EC2, S3, and more. All labs are Free Tier-safe and based on real-world cloud architecture.

## About Me

I'm building this portfolio to master AWS cloud architecture and prepare for roles in cloud engineering, solutions architecture, or DevOps. All labs and projects are done without CLI â€” 100% Console-based and Free Tier safe.
